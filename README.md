# 🎸 Band Name Generator 🎤

Python project that generates a creative band name based on your personal inputs!

## 🧠 What I Learned

This project helped me understand and practice the following foundational Python concepts:

- 🖨️ **Printing**: Displaying messages to the user using `print()`
- 💬 **Commenting**: Writing readable and maintainable code
- 🐞 **Debugging**: Identifying and fixing simple code issues
- 🧵 **String Manipulation**: Combining strings using concatenation
- 📦 **Variables**: Storing user input and reusing it

## 🚀 How It Works

The script asks the user for:
- The name of the city they grew up in
- The name of their pet
- The month they were born in

It then generates a potential band name using this information.
